    <p class="skills-paragraph">Skills are the abilities and expertise that enable individuals
        to perform tasks and solve problems effectively. They can be categorized into two main types:
        hard skills and soft skills. Hard skills are technical abilities that are often learned through 
        formal education, training, or hands-on experience. Examples include coding, data analysis, graphic design, and writing. 
        Soft skills, on the other hand, are interpersonal and personal attributes that influence how we interact with others. 
        Communication, teamwork, time management, and problem-solving are key examples.</p>
        
        
    </p class="skills-paragraph">The process of acquiring skills is lifelong. Continuous learning is essential to keep up with 
    advancements in technology, industry trends, and personal development. Whether through formal education, online courses, 
    or self-directed learning, expanding ones skill set opens up new opportunities and enhances confidence.</p>
